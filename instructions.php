                <p class="mt-4 text-gray-300">
                    "No, Bad Ideas!" is a collaborative and competitive board game for 2-4 players. It simulates the chaotic, challenging, and ultimately rewarding process of taking a client brief from initial concept to a full campaign launch. At the start of the game, players choose an Agency Role to represent them on their journey, coordinating with various internal and external partners to navigate the project timeline. The game is designed to teach media professionals about the creative process, fostering empathy and better collaboration.

                <p class="mt-4 text-gray-300">
                    The game is played over five separate phases. The player who wins a phase by being the first to reach the end of the board is awarded a prestigious NZ advertising award. The ultimate objective is to win the most awards. The player with the most awards at the end of the five phases wins the grand prize: a coveted Cannes Lion.

                <p class="mt-4 text-gray-300">
                    The game board is divided into five distinct phases, like lines on a subway map. Each phase is a self-contained competition with a key deliverable.

                <p class="mt-4 text-gray-300">
                    The goal is to be the first to complete each campaign phase and win an award token. The player with the most awards after five phases wins!

                <ol class="mt-4 list-decimal list-inside text-gray-300 space-y-2">
                    <li><b>Setup:</b> All players place their chosen Role token on the starting space of the current phase.</li>

                    <li>Once per phase, you may choose to draw a "Media Boost" card from the pile and play it immediately.</li>
                    <li><b>Winning a Phase:</b> The first player to land on or pass the final space of a board wins the phase and collects the Award Card for that phase. The phase then immediately ends, and all players move their tokens to the start of the next phase.</li>

                    <li><b>Win the Phase & Collect an Award:</b> The first player to land on or pass the final space of the current board immediately wins that phase and collects the corresponding award card.</li>
